###This file contains the code I used for refinng the original dataset with 210 samples to the 190 samples that were used in our study

# Copy the gff directory from nfs into your lustre
cp -r /nfs/pathogen/cholera_club/O-antiseq_JVIserogroupRefStrainOantigenLPSloci/gff dir.gff_samples`

# Create a file_list with all the samples\
ls /nfs/pathogen/cholera_club/O-antiseq_JVIserogroupRefStrainOantigenLPSloci/gff > file_list.txt`

# Remove the .gff file extension from the sample names in the file_list 
sed 's/\.gff$//' file_list.txt > file_list_noext.txt`

# Make list of serogroups to remove from list in excel 
# This was done in an [excel sreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYOf-7zdLE6Z67yM-SPfJGVH4BGBFUrV/edit#gid=1880666571) which contains metadata of the sampled in our dataset. I found the sample IDs of the non-vibrio cholera samples, and added these to a blank page in the text-editor BBEdit. These were then copy-pasted into a text-file in the terminal using nano.
nano remove_samples.txt
remove_samples = [
    "SRO154_LPS", "SRO195_LPS", "SRO21_LPS", "SRO31_LPS", "SRO33_LPS",
    "SRO72_LPS", "SRO101_LPS", "SRO114_LPS", "SRO115_LPS", "SRO116_LPS",
    "SRO117_LPS", "SRO135_LPS", "SRO138_LPS", "SRO194_LPS", "SRO201_LPS",
    "SRO202_LPS"
]
# Remove the non-cholera samples from the original file_list to produce a new list of cholera-only samples
grep -v -f remove_samples.txt file_list_noext.txt > cholera_samples_list.txt

# Remove '_LPS' from the end of each sample name 
sed -i 's/_LPS//' cholera_samples_list.txt

# Create a new directory with only the cholera samples 
for i in $(cat cholera_samples_list.txt); do cp /nfs/pathogen/cholera_club/O-antiseq_JVIserogroupRefStrainOantigenLPSloci/gff/${i}.gff dir.cholera_gff_190 ; done
