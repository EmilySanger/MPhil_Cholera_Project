## Finding directories
Three important directories to know 
1.	**The main PaM cholera directory in nfs**\
This is where the cholera data is found/stored.\
Pathway: `/nfs/pathogen/cholera_club/O-antiseq_JVIserogroupRefStrainOantigenLPSloci/`

2.	**Your ep16 directory in lustre**\
This is where you use/copy the cholera data and do your own calculations/computations.\
Pathway: `/lustre/scratch125/pam/teams/team216/ep16/`

3.	**Your ep16 directory in nfs**\
This is where you store your results.\
Pathway: `/nfs/users/nfs_e/ep16`
